                Above all else, web accessibility is about making your site
                usable for as many people as possible. In our modern age, access
                to technology and the Internet is a human right, regardless of
                one's abilities. This is easy to overlook. It's fun to build new
                apps and websites, but it's less fun to learn that many people
                aren't able to use them. So how do we address this?
              </p>
              {/* <p className={classes.paragraph}>
                Accessibility tends to show up late; the topic is often ignored
                during tech education and is often an afterthought in web and
                app projects. Implementing accessibility can therefore appear to
                be a daunting task, but my hope is to ease this process as much
                as possible and eventually rethink how we approach design and
                development by including accessibility in the earliest possible
                stages.
                It's never too late to work on accessibility, but it's never too early either.
