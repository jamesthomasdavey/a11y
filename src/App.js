            I love the challenge of deconstructing unfamiliar or complex
            interfaces into simplified operable parts, finding ways to linearize
            two-dimentional layouts, and allowing assistive technology to read
            and operate everything. Few things satisfy me more than using a
            keyboard to navigate a robustly-built website with the screen reader
            on.

          <p className={classes.paragraph}>
            Accessibility tends to show up late; whether in peoples' engineering
            careers because the topic was either ignored or only briefly
            mentioned in school or bootcamps, or in projects because users with
            disabilities were not considered in the design and development
            stages. Accessibility can therefore appear to be a daunting task,
            but my hope is too ease this process as much as possible and involve
            accessibility in the earliest stages. It's never too late to start
            accessibility, but it's never too early either.
