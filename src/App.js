          <strong>Accessibility Engineer</strong>, I love the challenge of
          deconstructing unfamiliar or complex interfaces into simplified
          operable parts. Few things satisfy me more than using a keyboard to
          navigate a newly-remediated site with the screen reader on.

            Accessibility is often either ignored or only briefly mentioned in
            front-end development courses and bootcamps. When developers hear
            about accessibility, often much later in their career, they realize
            they must unlearn and relearn basic techniques. My hope is to ease
            this process as much as possible.

            If accessibility is included during the design phase, then
            accessible developing should be as simple as using code to uphold
            the affordances and content from the design. If accessibility is
            included later, it may take more work, but you still have options.
            It's never too late to start accessibility, but it's never too early
            either.
