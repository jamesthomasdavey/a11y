                I love the challenges of deconstructing unfamiliar or complex
                interfaces into simplified operable parts, linearizing
                two-dimentional layouts, and allowing assistive technology to
                read and interact with everything. Few things satisfy me more
                than using a keyboard to navigate a robustly-built website with
                the screen reader enabled.

                Accessibility tends to show up late; the topic is often ignored
                during tech education and is often an afterthought in web and
                app projects. Implementing accessibility can therefore appear to
                be a daunting task, but my hope is to ease this process as much
                as possible and eventually rethink how we approach design and
                development by including accessibility in the earliest possible
                stages.
